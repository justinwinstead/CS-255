# CS-255: System Analysis &amp; Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client for the DriverPass project was the owner of the company. They wanted us to design a learning management system for driver's training. The system also booked behind-the-wheel appointments for training and allowed users to purchase a driver's training package to access DriverPass services. The LMS was intended to be a cloud-based application for the client's ease of use.

What did you do particularly well?

I understood the requirements of the system rather well. I used this understanding to develop a basic design for the system. I felt that all aspects of my design were adequate, but could see remarkable improvement with further iteration.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the entirety of my business requirements document. I have a stronger understanding of the system after analyzing it and creating diagrams for the application. I can use this new knowledge to address requirements that I may have missed initially. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I took note of the user's needs and broke them down into functional and nonfunctional requirements. I was able to create a robust list of requirements and used those to model the rest of my system design. Systems are designed to help their users complete tasks. If analysts are unable to address the needs of the user, the program will not serve its intended purpose. Therefore, user needs are vital to the systems development process.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I try to stress the importance of iteration in my software design approach. Analysts must understand that they will likely make mistakes during their initial system design. By iterating on previous work, I ensure that I have the most accurate representation of the system in development as possible. I will use interviewing and document analysis to gather requirements for a system. These techniques will be paired with UML Class, Activity, and Sequence diagrams to better understand and visualize my software.
